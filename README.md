# Rewise — Revise Smarter, Not Harder!

Rewise is a project that transforms previous year college question papers into interactive quizzes and flashcards for efficient last-minute revision.

## Motivation
Students often struggle to go through lengthy past papers during exams. Rewise addresses this by converting them into interactive formats to support better retention and quicker revision.

## Features
- Upload scanned or text-based question papers
- Automatic classification of questions:
  - MCQs → Quiz format
  - Short/Long answers → Flashcards
- Clean and responsive user interface
- Supports interactive self-testing and revision
